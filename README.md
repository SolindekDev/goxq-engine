# Goxq 
Open source, Lightweight Browser Engine written in C. This repository browser engine and render engine source code.

I don't want to create from this project a new Firefox or Chrome but just an little cool project on which i can have some fun. If
you like this idea and want tk contribute, the gate is open and you can do that in every moment! I will appreciate that.

First idea of creating an Browser Engine gone to my head about 3 year ago when i thought "How about creating an Browser?"
this idea beat me up because i was a new programmer and i didn't even know how does the browser work. After a year i've finally 
got something up and running it was [CoolCow](https://github.com/solindekdev/coolcow) this was supposed to be an super browser 
engine but after setting up UI the window was more laggy than fortnite on PC from '90. That wasn't good so i leaved that project
and gone on in this time I've created lot's of cool stuff, but the browser project was always my dream. That's how Goxq have been created.
